# Known Issues

Tracked gaps deferred for later resolution (typically during end-to-end testing).

## KI-1 — Device not enumerated by hidapi even with hidraw access (RESOLVED 2026-06-20)

**Symptom:** `asm-cli list` reports "no recognized SteelSeries device connected" on the
target machine even though the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless (`1038:12e5`) is physically present.

**Status of investigation (2026-06-20):**
- Device present: `lsusb` shows `1038:12e5`. Control interface confirmed at `/dev/hidraw1`
  (`bInterfaceNumber=04`), which matches the descriptor's `interface = 4`.
- **Permission blocker RESOLVED:** installed `packaging/udev/70-arctis-sound-manager.rules`
  (the prior `99-steelseries.rules` applied `uaccess` after `73-seat-late`, so no ACL was
  granted). `getfacl /dev/hidraw1` now shows `user:jj:rw-` — the user can open the node.
- **Remaining problem:** with access granted, `asm-cli list` STILL finds nothing. So the
  cause is NOT (only) permissions — it is in hidapi (`linux-native`) enumeration of this
  device and/or our `discover()` interface-number matching.

**Leading hypotheses to test (when resumed):**
1. Re-run an unfiltered hidapi enumeration dump now that `jj` has access — does `1038:12e5`
   appear at all, and what `interface_number` does hidapi report for it? (Earlier, before the
   ACL, it was absent; a root-only sibling device WAS listed, suggesting `linux-native`
   enumeration is quirky for some composite/wireless devices.)
2. If hidapi reports `interface_number = -1` (or not 4) for the control node, our
   `discover()` filter `info.interface_number() == descriptor.interface` would reject it.
   Consider matching by usage_page/usage, or relaxing the interface match, or selecting the
   node by report-descriptor characteristics.
3. Possible `hidapi` `linux-native` limitation with this device — compare against the
   default `hidapi` backend (libusb/hidraw via the C lib) as a fallback.

**Diagnostic aid:** a throwaway `crates/device/examples/hid_dump.rs` was used (since removed);
re-add a `asm-cli doctor` command (planned for Plan 2 diagnostics) that dumps all enumerated
HID devices and, when none match, checks `lsusb`/sysfs for a `1038:` device and prints a
permission/enumeration hint instead of a bare "no device" message.

**Does not block:** building the audio engine (PipeWire, independent of HID), config, and
engine structure. Revisit during E2E hardware testing.

**RESOLUTION (2026-06-20):** root cause was the `hidapi` `linux-native` (pure-Rust) backend
not enumerating this composite wireless device. Switching to the C `linux-static-hidraw`
backend fixes it. Validated on real HW (owner-run): `asm-cli list` finds
"Arctis Nova Pro Wireless (1038:12e5) on interface 4"; `asm-cli probe` reads
`battery_charge: 100%` and `mic_muted: false`. Build deps: `systemd-devel` + C toolchain.

## KI-2 — Audio backend writes filter-chain conf to a predictable /tmp path (LOW, OPEN)

`AudioBackend::create` writes the filter-chain `.conf` to a predictable `/tmp/arctis_eq.<node_name>.conf`
path. Low severity (local, non-privileged audio utility), but a local user could pre-place a symlink
there. Follow-up: write to `~/.config/arctis-sound-manager/` or use `tempfile::NamedTempFile` with a
stable rename. Also: the conf filename doubles the name (`arctis_eq.arctis_eq.conf`) when node_name ==
the literal prefix — cosmetic. And `AudioError::Spawn{program:"write-conf"}` is reused for file-I/O
errors; add a dedicated `AudioError::Io` variant in a later pass. Revisit in the engine-orchestrator plan.

**Update 2026-07-02:** still open — the mic chain and surround graphs write their confs under the same
`std::env::temp_dir()` scheme (`/tmp/arctis_<base>.conf`), and the new diff-before-recreate guard
byte-compares against these same paths. The move to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (or a tempfile+rename) remains
deferred.

## KI-3 — Route re-apply on stream resume requires the `pw-watcher` build feature (OPEN, by design)

Remembered routes are applied to an app's current stream on an explicit move. When the app goes idle
PipeWire destroys that stream, so on resume it can fall back to the default sink. The fix — a
`pipewire-rs` registry watcher that re-applies routes by app binary on stream (re)appearance — is
behind the **off-by-default `pw-watcher` Cargo feature** (`crates/cli`), because the `pipewire` crate
links libpipewire and needs `pipewire-devel` + `clang` at build time (libspa-sys bindgen). Without the
feature, `RouteWatcher` compiles to a no-op stub and routes do not auto-recover on resume. Build with
`cargo build -p arctis-cli --features pw-watcher` to enable it. The pure route-lookup logic is always
compiled and unit-tested; the live registry loop is owner-verified (it needs a real PipeWire session).

## KI-4 — Surround render test races on a shared `/tmp` conf path under parallel `cargo test` (LOW, OPEN)

One surround-backend test (`apply_surround_game_eq_*_channel_sink_flat`) and a couple of siblings write
to the shared `/tmp/arctis_arctis_surround.conf` path, so they can intermittently fail when `cargo test`
runs them in parallel. They pass deterministically with `cargo test -- --test-threads=1` or in
isolation. Follow-up: give each test a unique temp conf path (per KI-2's tempfile direction).

## KI-5 — CI rustfmt is advisory, not enforced (OPEN, by design)

The codebase uses a deliberately dense/compact style. `cargo fmt --check` would reformat ~22 files
(191 hunks at minimum), and no stable `rustfmt.toml` preserves the style (every config tested increased
churn). The CI `cargo fmt --all -- --check` step is therefore `continue-on-error: true` — it still runs
for visibility but does not gate merges. Run `cargo fmt` deliberately if/when adopting rustfmt wholesale.

## KI-6 — WirePlumber restore-stream can undo a cleared route on the app's next launch (OPEN, upstream limitation)

WirePlumber's restore-stream module (setting `node.stream.restore-target`, default **true**) remembers
every manual `target.object` move in `~/.local/state/wireplumber/restore-stream`, keyed per app. When a
route is cleared, ASM removes its own persisted rule everywhere (profile, `routes.json`, conf
fragments) and deletes the live metadata key — but WirePlumber's stored state survives, so the app's
NEXT stream can be placed straight back on the old Arctis sink. There is **no supported way to clear a
single app's stored target at runtime**: the state file is only read at WirePlumber startup and is
rewritten by the running daemon, so editing it requires stopping WirePlumber (a service restart ASM
refuses to do — G3). The GUI/CLI clear-route responses therefore carry a note: move the app once to the
desired sink to re-teach the stored target. To disable the behaviour globally (all apps, at your own
preference): `wpctl settings node.stream.restore-target false` (runtime), or persist
`wireplumber.settings = { node.stream.restore-target = false }` in
`~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/`.

## KI-7 — Surround `Auto` re-resolves the input layout only on reconcile / surround setters (OPEN, documented TODO)

`Auto` mode probes the richest negotiated input layout (read-only, TTL-cached `pw-dump`) only when
`apply_surround` runs — i.e. on reconcile and on the surround setters. If the feeding app *changes*
its negotiated layout while playing (stereo ↔ 5.1/7.1), the rendered graph is not re-applied live: a
live re-apply would need an engine hook from a stream watcher, and `crates/cli/src/route_watcher.rs`
only rewrites route metadata (it has no engine handle). Tracked as a `TODO(pw-watcher)` in the engine
crate's surround apply path. Workaround: toggle surround or run `asm-cli apply` after the format change.

## KI-8 — GUI does not yet render `Response.note` advisories (OPEN)

Daemon responses can carry an advisory `note` (currently the KI-6 restore-stream caveat on
`RouteClear`). The CLI prints it; the GUI's IPC layer ignores the field, so GUI users never see the
advisory (the GUI also does not yet compare the `daemon_version` handshake against its own version).
Frontend wiring is a follow-up.
